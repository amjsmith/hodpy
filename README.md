# hodpy

This repository contains code for creating HOD mock catalogues for the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey. 
The mock galaxies are assigned r-band absolute magnitudes and rest-frame g-r colours, which are then k-corrected to the observed apparent magnitudes and colours. 
The code can be run on either cubic box or lightcone halo catalogues, and we also provide scripts to produce 'cut-sky' mocks, which convert the cubic box to sky coordinates.

## make_mocks

This directory contains scripts for generating mock catalogues

* make_catalogue_snapshot_abacus.py - make an AbacusSummit cubic box mock

## lookup

This directory contains various files which are used in the mock creation process

## TODO: update README
